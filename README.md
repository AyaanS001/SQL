 ## [E-Commerce Sales Analysis](https://github.com/AyaanS001/SQL/blob/main/E-CommerceScript.sql) - SQL
 ### Overview: This project analyzes sales performance using an E-Commerce Sales Dataset with SQLite and DBeaver. The goal is to extract key business insights related to:
Total sales revenue & order trends,
Top-selling products,

Seasonal sales trends,
Best days of the week for sales.

#### Key Business Questions to Answer:
1) What are the total sales revenue and the number of orders?
2) Which products generate the most revenue?
3) What are the monthly sales trends?
4) Who are the top customers by total spending?
5) Which days of the week see the highest sales?
6) What is the average order value (AOV), and how does it vary by customer segment?
7) Which product categories contribute the most to total revenue, and how has their performance changed over time?
8) What is the customer retention rate based on repeat purchases?
9) What percentage of revenue comes from new vs. returning customers?
10) How do discounts and promotions impact sales volume and revenue?

## SQL Data Wrangling Project: Customer Subscriptions Analysis

### Overview
This project showcases my **SQL data wrangling** skills using **DBeaver with SQLite**. The dataset contains **customer subscription and transaction details** from an e-commerce platform. I performed **data cleaning, normalization, aggregation, and visualization** to derive key business insights.

---

## Key Steps in Data Wrangling
### **Data Cleaning**
âœ… Checked for missing values and inconsistencies.  
âœ… Standardized **text columns** (lowercase/uppercase).  
âœ… Converted **transaction dates** from TEXT to DATE format.  
âœ… Removed **duplicate records** while preserving the earliest transaction.

###  Technologies & Tools Used
âœ… **SQL (SQLite via DBeaver)** â€“ Data wrangling, cleaning, querying, aggregation.  
âœ… **Python (Matplotlib, Pandas)** â€“ Data visualization and trend analysis.  
âœ… **GitHub** â€“ Documentation and portfolio showcase.  

### **Data Normalization**
The raw dataset was **split into three relational tables** for better structure:
- **`customers`**: Stores customer details (ID, gender, age group, country).
- **`subscriptions`**: Tracks subscription plans and pricing per customer.
- **`transactions`**: Records customer transactions (initial signups, reductions, cancellations).

### **Data Aggregation & Key Metrics**
âœ… **Total Revenue**: The Sum of all subscription payments.  
âœ… **Average Subscription Price**: Helps analyze customer spending trends.  
âœ… **Customer Churn Rate**: % of users who downgraded or canceled subscriptions.  
âœ… **Top High-Value Customers**: Identified based on total spending.  
âœ… **Subscription Trends Over Time**: Tracked new signups per month.

### **Data Visualization (Matplotlib)**
- **Subscription Trends Over Time:** ðŸ“ˆ Created a **line chart** to visualize **monthly new subscriptions**.
- **Enhanced Trend Analysis:** ðŸ”´ Added a **moving average trendline** and highlighted key **peak/low months**.

---

## Project Results
- ** Peak Subscription Month:** March 2022 (**318 new subscriptions**).  
- ** Lowest Subscription Month:** September 2022 (**255 new subscriptions**).  
- ** Average Monthly Subscriptions:** ~290-300 new customers.  
- ** Churn Rate Insights:** Customers tend to churn **after 6+ months** of subscription.
